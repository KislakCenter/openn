### About St. George's United Methodist Church of Philadelphia

Historic St. George's United Methodist Church of Philadelphia is the
oldest Methodist Church in America. Located in Philadelphia, the church
was founded by Captain Thomas Webb and the Methodist Society of
Philadelphia in 1769 for the purpose of practicing the Methodist
religion. In December of 1769, Joseph Pilmore, a missionary of John
Wesley, held the first prayer meeting at the church followed later by
Thomas Coke and Bishop Francis Asbury. Bishop Asbury was the first
pastor of St. George's United Methodist Church and ordained as many as
35 ministers in the Methodist faith within America during his travels.
Two African Americans, Richard Allen and Absalom Jones, licensed as lay
preachers of Methodism, eventually left the church because of racial
tensions and formed two new congregations. Richard Allen formed Mother
Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Absalom Jones turned to the
Episcopal faith and established St. Thomas' African Episcopal Church.
St. George's is known as "the church that moved the bridge," as the
Benjamin Franklin Bridge was rerouted in the 1920s so the church would
not be demolished by its construction. St. George's records consist of
conference letters; account books; baptism, death, and marriage records;
as well as journals, diaries, etc.
