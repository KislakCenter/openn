### About the Legacy Center, Drexel University College of Medicine

The Drexel University College of Medicine Legacy Center supports
research and investigation of the history of women in medicine,
history of homeopathic medicine in the United States, and the history
of women's health. Our collections are accessible online and in our
reading room in Philadelphia. We work regularly with K-12 students and
teachers, graduate and undergraduate students, scholars, and
genealogists.

The Center is the repository for records documenting the history of
the College and its predecessor institutions, including Woman's
Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann University. Special
collections emerging from these institutions' unique and original
missions to educate women physicians and to teach homeopathy reflect
the activity of individuals, institutions, and organizations. Over
4,000 linear feet of materials date from 1502 to the present, with the
bulk of the materials ranging from 1848-1990.

### Standards and scanning specifications

In general, the Legacy Center digitizes material at the highest
possible quality, with a minimum standard for master files of 400ppi,
8-bit grayscale or 24-bit color uncompressed tiffs. Scanning and
processing equipment include an Epson Expression 10000XL and a
PhaseOne P30 digital camera.
