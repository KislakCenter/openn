<h2>Sponsorship</h2>

<p>Images of manuscripts from the Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection
and from the Penn Collections were digitized through grants from the
National Endowment for the Humanities. The Division of Preservation
and Access of the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the
Penn Libraries two grants (in 2009 and 2011) to prepare digital
facsimiles of approximately 2,200 European and American manuscripts
from the eleventh through the eighteenth centuries. Imaging has been
undertaken by the staff of the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text &
Image with coordination from manuscripts staff in the Kislak Center
for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts.</p>

<p>Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in
this website do not necessarily reflect those of the National
Endowment for the Humanities.</p>

<h2>Intended audiences</h2>

<p>The data on OPenn is intended for aggregators, digital humanists,
and scholars who have been directed here to procure high-resolution
images of manuscript pages. It is presented in a manner most likely to
ensure its long-term digital preservation. For those who would prefer
to experience the data in a more user-friendly way, we suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/index.html">Penn
in Hand</a>, bibliographic information and digital facsimiles for
selected collections of manuscripts
(<a href="http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/index.html">http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/index.html</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<h3>Manuscripts</h3>

<p>Penn holds over 2,000 Western manuscripts produced before the
nineteenth century. Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts comprise
approximately 900 items. The Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection
emphasizes secular topics, especially science and
mathematics. Holdings represented here are from Penn's Kislak Center
for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, as well as from
the private collection of Lawrence J. Schoenberg. The images of these
manuscripts are accompanied by detailed manuscript descriptions in
machine-readable TEI format. Images and TEI manuscript descriptions
are added frequently, so check often to see new additions.</p>

<p>We intend to collaborate with outside institutions in the
Philadelphia area to bring OPenn data to the public. Check back to see
new collections.</p>

<h3>Manuscript images</h3>

<p>In general, Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image follows
the NISO standards as articulated in A Framework for Building Good
Digital Collections, 3rd Edition
(<a href="http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/framework3.pdf">http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/framework3.pdf</a>). The
following represents specific standards adopted by SCETI in their
capture of digital images.</p>

<h4>Scanning specifications</h4>

<li>Archival Masters: 600 ppi 24-bit raw TIFF image, 600 ppi 24-bit
LZW color image</li>
<li>"Golden Thread" color target is used for every exposure. Target
also includes interference pattern and inch/centimeter
markings. Target is also used to check focus.</li>

<h4>Scanning & processing equipment</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cameras: Two auto-focus, 39 megapixel, Phase One P45 digital
    cameras.</li>
  <li>Lenses: Schneider-Kreuznach lenses</li>
  <li>Software: Phase One Capture One Pro; Photoshop CS3</li>
</ul>

<p>Master images are captured at a resolution of at least 600 pixels
per inch of the image subject. Once all of the images for a manuscript
have been captured they are color-corrected, deskewed, and
cropped.</p>

<h4>Images</h4>

<p>Three types of images are delivered for each manuscript element:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a full-sized, archival TIFF image, (600 ppi text folios);</li>
  <li>a standard all-purpose JPEG intended for web use, that is 1800
    pixels on its longest side; and</li>
  <li>a thumbnail JPEG that is 190 pixels on its longest side.</li>
</ol>

<p>All TIFF images are master files. JPEG derivative image types are
indicated by a "tag." For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>0023_0012.tif</tt></li>
  <li><tt>0023_0012_web.jpg</tt></li>
  <li><tt>0023_0012_thumb.jpg</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>The file name base (e.g., 0023_0012) has two parts: a four-digit
prefix, representing an arbitrarily assigned identifier, like 0023,
and a four-digit serial number indicating the document order of each
image relative to the others in the set. For example, notice these
master image names:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>0023_0001.tif</tt> - outside front cover of book</li>
  <li><tt>0023_0002.tif</tt> - inside front cover of book</li>
  <li><tt>0023_0003.tif</tt> - front flyleaf i recto</li>
  <li><tt>0023_0004.tif</tt> - front flyleaf i verso</li>
  <li><tt>0023_0005.tif</tt> - folio 1r</li>
  <li><tt>0023_0006.tif</tt> - folio 1v</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Label information for images can be found on each document’s browse
page and in the TEI XML manuscript description.</p>

<h3>Manuscript descriptions</h3>

<p>Manuscript cataloging incorporates not only the identification of
the author, title, date of origin, and provenance, but also, detailed
descriptions intended to aid the palaeographer, codicologist, art
historian, historian, and philologist. A description of the manuscript
cataloging, with technical and non-technical detail, is given in the
document ManuscriptDescription.html (TBD).</p>

<h2>How to use this data set</h2>

<p>This data set contains complete digital surrogates for the
manuscripts it contains. All manuscripts are provided with
machine-readable TEI manuscript descriptions. We provide HTML access
to the files, which is easier for the individual user to
navigate. HTML and directory structure access are described below.</p>

<h3>HTML access</h3>

<p>To ease human navigation of the site, a series of web pages is
provided. The entry point is
the <a href="/3_Collections.html">3_Collections.html</a> file, which
lists all of the collections currently on the site. There links can be
found to collection-specific manuscript listings (files
like <a href="/TOC_LJSchoenbergManuscripts.html">TOC_LJSchoenberg_Manuscripts.html</a>).
The amount of detail for each manuscript varies, based on the
manuscript's catalog record.</p>

<p>A typical entry for a manuscript will look something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="item-id">LJS 208:</span>
    <span class="item-name">Opusculum mathematicum</span>
    <span class="item-origin">(Genoa?, Italy, 1675.)</span>
    <br>
    <span class="page-link"><a href="/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/html/ljs208.html">Browse</a></span> |
    <span class="page-link"><a href="/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs208/data/ljs208_TEI.xml">TEI XML</a></span> |
    <span class="page-link"><a href="/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs208">Data</a></span>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Collections on OPenn</h2>

<p>In addition to Penn manuscripts, this data set will soon include
images from books and manuscripts from non-Penn collections. Note that
each of these items has its own licensing terms, and it is the
responsibility of each user to understand and adhere to those
terms.</p>
