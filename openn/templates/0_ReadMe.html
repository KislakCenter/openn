## Sponsorship

Images of manuscripts from the Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection and
from the Penn Collections were digitized through grants from the
National Endowment for the Humanities. The Division of Preservation
and Access of the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the
Penn Libraries two grants (in 2009 and 2011) to prepare digital
facsimiles of approximately 2,200 European and American manuscripts
from the eleventh through the eighteenth centuries. Imaging has been
undertaken by the staff of the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text &
Image with coordination from manuscripts staff in the Kislak Center
for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts.

Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this
website do not necessarily reflect those of the National Endowment for
the Humanities.

## Intended audiences

The data on OPenn is intended for aggregators, digital humanists, and
scholars who have been directed here to procure high-resolution images
of manuscript pages. It is presented in a manner most likely to ensure
its long-term digital preservation. For those who would prefer to
experience the data in a more user-friendly way, we suggest:

- [Penn in Hand][pih], bibliographic information and digital
  facsimiles for selected collections of manuscripts
  (<http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/index.html>).

## Contents

### Manuscripts

Penn holds over 2,000 Western manuscripts produced before the
nineteenth century. Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts comprise
approximately 900 items. The Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection
emphasizes secular topics, especially science and
mathematics. Holdings represented here are from Penn's Kislak Center
for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, as well as from
the private collection of Lawrence J. Schoenberg. The images of these
manuscripts are accompanied by detailed manuscript descriptions in
machine-readable TEI format. Images and TEI manuscript descriptions
are added frequently, so check often to see new additions.

We intend to collaborate with outside institutions in the Philadelphia
area to bring OPenn data to the public. Check back to see new
collections.

### Manuscript images

In general, Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image follows the
NISO standards as articulated in A Framework for Building Good Digital
Collections, 3rd Edition
(<http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/framework3.pdf>). The following
represents specific standards adopted by SCETI in their capture of
digital images.

#### Scanning specifications

- Archival Masters: 600 ppi 24-bit raw TIFF image, 600 ppi 24-bit LZW
  color image* "Golden Thread" color target is used for every
  exposure. Target also includes interference pattern and
  inch/centimeter markings. Target is also used to check focus.  ####
  Scanning & processing equipment
- Cameras: Two auto-focus, 39 megapixel, Phase One P45 digital
  cameras.
- Lenses: Schneider-Kreuznach lenses
- Software: Phase One Capture One Pro; Photoshop CS3

Master images are captured at a resolution of at least 600 pixels per
inch of the image subject. Once all of the images for a manuscript
have been captured they are color-corrected, deskewed, and cropped.

#### Images

Three types of images are delivered for each manuscript element:

1. a full-sized, archival TIFF image, (600 ppi text folios);
2. a standard all-purpose JPEG intended for web use, that is 1800
   pixels on its longest side; and
3. a thumbnail JPEG that is 190 pixels on its longest side.

All TIFF images are master files. JPEG derivative image types are indicated by a "tag." For example,

- `0023_0012.tif`
- `0023_0012_web.jpg`
- `0023_0012_thumb.jpg`

The file name base (e.g., `0023_0012`) has two parts: a four-digit
prefix, representing an arbitrarily assigned identifier, like 0023,
and a four-digit serial number indicating the document order of each
image relative to the others in the set. For example, notice these
master image names:

- `0023_0001.tif` - outside front cover of book
- `0023_0002.tif` - inside front cover of book
- `0023_0003.tif` - front flyleaf i recto
- `0023_0004.tif` - front flyleaf i verso
- `0023_0005.tif` - folio 1r
- `0023_0006.tif` - folio 1v
-   ...

Label information for images can be found on each document's browse
page and in the TEI XML manuscript description.

### Manuscript descriptions

Manuscript cataloging incorporates not only the identification of the
author, title, date of origin, and provenance, but also, detailed
descriptions intended to aid the palaeographer, codicologist, art
historian, historian, and philologist. A description of the manuscript
cataloging, with technical and non-technical detail, is given in the
document ManuscriptDescription.html (TBD).

## How to use this data set

This data set contains complete digital surrogates for the manuscripts
it contains. All manuscripts are provided with machine-readable TEI
manuscript descriptions. We provide HTML access to the files, which is
easier for the individual user to navigate. HTML and directory
structure access are described below.

### HTML access

To ease human navigation of the site, a series of web pages is
provided. The entry point is the
[3_Collections.html](/3_Collections.html) file, which lists all of the
collections currently on the site. There links can be found to
collection-specific manuscript listings (files like
[TOC_LJSchoenberg_Manuscripts.html](/TOC_LJSchoenbergManuscripts.html)). The
amount of detail for each manuscript varies, based on the manuscript's
catalog record.

A typical entry for a manuscript will look something like this:

{% endmarkdown %}
<ul>
<li><span class="item-id">LJS 208:</span> <span class="item-name">Opusculum mathematicum</span> <span class="item-origin">(Genoa?, Italy, 1675.)</span><br/>
    <span class="page-link"><a
    href="/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/html/ljs208.html">Browse</a></span>
    | <span class="page-link"><a
    href="/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs208/data/ljs208_TEI.xml">TEI
    XML</a></span> | <span class="page-link"><a href="/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs208">Data</a></span></li>
</ul>

{% markdown %}

## Collections on OPenn

In addition to Penn manuscripts, this data set will soon include
images from books and manuscripts from non-Penn collections. Note that
each of these items has its own licensing terms, and it is the
responsibility of each user to understand and adhere to those terms.
