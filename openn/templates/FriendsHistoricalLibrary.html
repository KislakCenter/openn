### About the Friends Historical Library, Swarthmore College

Established in 1871 at Swarthmore College, two years after the College
opened, the Friends Historical Library documents the history of the
Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from their mid-seventeenth
century origins to the present. As the largest Quaker library in the
world, it includes materials on women's suffrage, the rights of Native
Americans, the anti-slavery movement, social activism, and the peace
movement.
