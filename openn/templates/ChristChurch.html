### About Christ Church

Founded in 1695, Christ Church was the first Anglican church to be
established in Pennsylvania. This fulfilled the provision outlined by
King Charles II in the charter he granted to William Penn in 1681
stipulating that if twenty individuals requested an Anglican clergyman
the Bishop of London would appoint one. Accordingly, thirty-nine
Philadelphians came together in 1695 to form Christ Church. Located on
Second Street, just north of Market Street the Church transitioned from
a small frame structure in its early years to the imposing Georgian
structure built from 1727-1754 that still stands on the site today.
Members of the Continental Congress and early government officials
worshipped here and seven signers of the Declaration of Independence are
buried on Church property. When the congregation grew too large to be
accommodated here the vestry built St. Peter's at the southern edge of
the city in 1760 and later St. James. Those United Churches remained a
unit until the 1820s and 1830s. Christ Church is an active Episcopal
parish today as well as a major historic site.

The records consist of vestry minutes, parish records, accounting and
financial records, deeds, architectural drawings, photographs, and
audiovisual materials. In addition, there are materials from parish
organizations and affiliated institutions such as Christ Church
Hospital, Episcopal School, Christ Church Burial Ground, and Christ
Church Preservation Trust. A detailed finding aid is available on-site.

OPenn includes some of the items from Christ Church. For more
