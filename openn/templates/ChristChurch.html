### About Christ Church

Christ Church is an Episcopal church located in the Old City section of
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was established in 1695 as a condition of
King Charles II of England's 1681 Charter to William Penn, which allowed
for the formation of Church of England congregations in Pennsylvania.
Several notable Philadelphians attended services at Christ Church
including Benjamin Franklin, Betsy Ross, and members of the Continental
Congress. Christ Church records, 1695-2016, document Christ Church and
its parish and congregation. The records consist of vestry minutes,
parish records, accounting and financial records, deeds, architectural
drawings, photographs, and audiovisual materials. In addition, there are
materials from parish organizations and affiliated institutions such as
Christ Church Hospital, Episcopal School, Christ Church Burial Ground,
and Christ Church Preservation Trust. A detailed finding aid is
available on-site.
 
OPenn includes some of the items from Christ Church. For more
