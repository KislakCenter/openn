### About the Rosenbach

The Rosenbach seeks to foster inquiry, learning and creative thought by
engaging audiences in programs, exhibitions, and research inspired by
our collections of nearly 400,000 rare books, manuscripts, and ﬁne and
decorative art objects, including some of the best-known literary and
historical objects in the world. In December 2013, the Rosenbach became
afﬁliated with the Free Library of Philadelphia, bringing together two
of the world’s preeminent collections of rare books, manuscripts,
Americana and art. The combined holdings of the Rosenbach and the Free
Library of Philadelphia inspire unique exhibitions and programs
throughout the year.

OPenn includes some of the items from the Rosenbach. For more

### Image standards and specifications

Images from the Rosenbach were shot and processed by the Schoenberg
Center for Electronic Text & Image. In general, The Schoenberg Center
for Electronic Text & Image follows the NISO standards as articulated in
*A Framework for Building Good Digital Collections*, 3rd Edition:

- <http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/framework3.pdf>.

The following represents specific standards adopted by SCETI in their
capture of digital images.

#### Image specifications

- Archival Masters: 600 ppi 24-bit raw TIFF color image
- "Golden Thread" color target is used for every exposure. Target also
  includes interference pattern and inch/centimeter markings. Target
  is also used to check focus.

#### Imaging and processing equipment

- Cameras: IQ280 80 megapixel Phase One digital camera
- Lenses: Schneider Kreuznach lenses
- Software: Phase One Capture One Pro; Photoshop CS3

Master images are captured at a resolution of at least 600 pixels per
inch of the image subject. Once all of the images for a manuscript have
been captured they are color-corrected, deskewed, and cropped.  

As of 2015, SCETI has been using IQ280 Phase One digital cameras;
however, OPenn contains images that were captured using different
equipment before this time. If you have questions about a specific
manuscript or image, please refer to the individual XMP files located in
the Data folder.  See a portion of a sample XMP file below:
