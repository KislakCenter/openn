The PACSCL Diaries Project will allow researchers an intimate view into a wide
variety of personalities, largely from Philadelphia, as they went about their
daily lives and commented on the world around them. The project will
ultimately provide an online archive of diaries drawn from PACSCL member
collections. OPenn currently hosts a pilot group of 53 diary volumes.
