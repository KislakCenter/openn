The [PACSCL Diaries Project][pacscl] allows researchers an intimate
view into a wide variety of personalities, largely from Philadelphia, as
they went about their daily lives and commented on the world around
them. The project provides an online archive of diaries drawn from 16
PACSCL member collections. OPenn currently hosts a pilot group of 63
diary volumes. Participating PACSCL member libraries are:

### Licensing

#### Images

Images and their contents from the PACSCL Diaries project are available
under various licenses.  Some are in the public domain and some are
available under a Creative Commons Attribution License version 4.0
(CC-BY-4.0).  Please check individual document pages to determine under

### Intended Users

The PACSCL Diaries data presented on OPenn is intended for aggregators,
digital humanists, and scholars who have been directed here to procure
high-resolution images and their associated metadata. It is presented in
a manner most likely to ensure its long-term digital preservation. The
images of these manuscripts are accompanied by detailed manuscript
descriptions in machine-readable TEI format. 

### Image Standards and Specifications

Most of the diaries have been previously digitized, with a small number
digitized by the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text and Image.  In
all cases, images with the highest resolution available were included in
this project. 

The images captured by the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text and
Image follow the NISO standards as articulated in *A Framework for
Building Good Digital Collections*, 3rd Edition:

- <http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/framework3.pdf>.

#### Image specifications

- Archival Masters: 600 ppi 24-bit raw TIFF color image
- "Golden Thread" color target is used for every exposure. Target also
  includes interference pattern and inch/centimeter markings. Target
  is also used to check focus.

#### Imaging and processing equipment

- Cameras: IQ280 80 megapixel Phase One digital camera
- Lenses: Schneider Kreuznach lenses
- Software: Phase One Capture One Pro; Photoshop CS3

Master images are captured at a resolution of at least 600 pixels per
inch of the image subject. Once all of the images for a manuscript have
been captured they are color-corrected, deskewed, and cropped.  

In 2015, SCETI began using IQ280 Phase One digital cameras; however,
OPenn contains images that were captured using different equipment
before this time. If you have questions about a specific manuscript or
image, please refer to the header of the Master image or images in
question or the accompanying XMP files.  You can see this, for example,
in the Master images for Penn Manuscript Ms. Codex 1096  at
<http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0002/mscodex1096/data/master/>.
Note the metadata in the image header of `0396_0000.tif` or in its
sidecar XMP file `0396_0000.tif.xmp` as seen below.
