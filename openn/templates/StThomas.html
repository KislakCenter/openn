### About the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas

The African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas was an outgrowth of the
African Church of Philadelphia founded in 1792 by the Free African
Society, a mutual aid organization, established in 1787 by Absalom Jones
and Richard Allen for the purpose of encouraging religion and literacy,
and providing destitute members--especially widows and orphans-- with
financial assistance. Absalom Jones led the congregation and became the
first African American admitted to Holy Orders in the Episcopal Church
when Bishop William White ordained him a deacon in 1796 and a priest in
1802. Richard Allen formed Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal
Church which became a separate Methodist denomination. Records consist
of vestry minutes, pew rents, birth and baptismal records, as well as
some records of the Free African Society.
