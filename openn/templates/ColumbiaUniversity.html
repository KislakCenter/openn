### About Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library

The Libraries at Columbia are at the heart of the University. The
collections serve the research needs of the Columbia faculty,
undergraduate and graduate students, and the community, while providing
a wealth of items for the use of scholars from around the world. The
Rare Book and Manuscript Library, largest of Columbia's repositories for
the special collections of the University, holds collections spanning
more than 4,000 years, from cuneiform tablets to born-digital objects. 
Some 600,000 printed books and 17 miles of manuscripts, personal papers,
and records form the core of the RBML holdings, along with well over one
million photographs, prints and drawings, maps, coins, scientific
instruments, playing cards, theater set models and other realia, and
audio and moving image materials.

The collections cover a broad range of subjects, and provide researchers
with a great depth of material to study. RBML holds important early
manuscripts and printed books in Arabic, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and a
wide variety of other languages. Particular collecting strengths include
the history of English and American literature, journalism, finance and
economics, mathematics and astronomy, printing and publishing, theater
and the performing arts, photography, American history, Russian and East
European Emigr√© history and culture, Hebraica and Judaica, and Latino
arts and activism. RBML is home to one of the oldest oral history
collections in the country, and is also the repository for archives that
support the mission of the Center for Human Rights Documentation and
Research.

Columbia's holdings in OPenn include many of RBML's Muslim world
manuscripts. For more information on the rest of their collections,
