### About St. Peter's Church

In 1758 the vestry of Christ Church authorized the construction of a new
chapel at Third and Pine Streets to accomodate its members living in the
southern section of the city. St. Peter's Church and Christ Church
shared the same vestry, ministers, and records and until they formally
separated in 1832 were known as the United Churches of Christ Church and
St. Peter's. The formal separation agreement stipulated that records
created prior to 1832 were to be maintained by Christ Church so
researchers looking for pre-1832 information should check Christ
Church's collections. Records created after 1832 are maintained by St.
Peter's, an active parish. Scanned for this project are minutes, pew
rents and registers.

### Image standards and specifications

The materials from St. Peter's Church on OPenn were scanned as part of a
CLIR-funded project to digitize the early records of Philadelphiaâ€™s
oldest congregations. Materials were digitized at the Regional Digital
Imaging Center of the Athenaeum of Philadelphia.
