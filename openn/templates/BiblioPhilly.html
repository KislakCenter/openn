### Sponsorship

Most of the manuscripts in this collection are being digitized and made
accessible through a *Digitizing Hidden Collections* grant from the
[Council on Library and Information Resources][clir], 2016-2019. The
grant program is made possible by funding from the [Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation] [mellon]. Imaging was undertaken by the staff of the
Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image and other partners, with
additional cataloging and coordination from manuscripts staff in the
Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts. A few
manuscripts that had previously been digitized are being contributed to
the collection.

Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this
