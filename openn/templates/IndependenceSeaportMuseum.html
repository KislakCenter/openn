is one of the nation's premier regional maritime research facilities.
 With a rich repository of regional documents, 12,000 ship plans, a
significant collection of rare books and manuscripts; maps and charts;

appreciation, and experience of Philadelphia’s regional waterways and
the Delaware watershed area for everyone, they carry national and
international significance.

The principal treasure of the department is its unique archival
collections: the letters, diaries, logs, business, financial and legal

scrapbook albums of sailors and captains (and their families),
shipbuilders, sail makers, merchants, nautical instrument makers,
social welfare organizations, insurers, explorers, travelers,
