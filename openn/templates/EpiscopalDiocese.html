### About the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania Archives

After the American Revolution, Anglicans became Episcopalians. Led by
the Reverend William White, they organized the Episcopal Diocese of
Pennsylvania in 1784. White became its first bishop three years later.
Initially, the Diocese spanned a vast area, extending from Philadelphia
to Pittsburgh, encompassing the whole of Pennsylvania. By 1910 there
were five Episcopal dioceses in Pennsylvania, and the Diocese of
Pennsylvania consisted of Philadelphia, Bucks, Montgomery, Chester, and
Delaware counties. 

The Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania's Archives are home to a vast
array of material relating to the people and parishes comprising the
Diocese as well as the Diocese itself. Within its stacks are material
relating to parishes that have closed, the registers, the vestry minutes
as well as documents making up the life of these churches which are no
longer with us. It also holds a large volume of histories, both at the
parish level comprising both active and closed parishes, as well as
histories of the diocese and its various organizations.

The Archives also holds a large volume of material related to those
committed to running the Diocese. There are records from the various
Bishops, Standing Committee and General Conventions, to better
understand the direction we have come from. There are also various print
runs of the publications the Diocese has put out as well including a
long run of the Church News.
