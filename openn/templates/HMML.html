### About the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library (HMML)

The Hill Museum & Manuscript Library (HMML), at Saint John's
University in Collegeville, Minnesota, is an internationally renowned
cultural heritage organization focused on partnering with communities of
origin to digitally preserve endangered manuscripts. HMML currently
holds the world's largest archive of manuscript photographs in both
microfilm and digital format. Its digital archives contain approximately
300,000 complete manuscripts, ranging in size from large codices of
hundreds of folios to brief documents consisting of just a few leaves.

HMML&#39;s mission is to preserve and share the world's handwritten past
to inspire a deeper understanding of our present and future, and
includes three major components: digitally preserving rare and
endangered manuscripts; archiving, cataloging and sharing manuscripts
online; fostering research on the thought and cultures represented in
the manuscripts.
