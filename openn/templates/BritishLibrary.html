### Image standards and specifications

In order to make the collection of Hebrew manuscripts available
digitally, the British Library received a major grant from The Polonsky
Foundation to support the Hebrew Manuscripts Digitisation Project
(HMDP).The project digitized 1,300 manuscripts, capturing approximately
435,000 digitised images. These were mainly manuscripts catalogued by
George Margoliouth at the end of the 19th century. In addition, several
Torah scrolls had textile covers (mantles), made of silk brocade and
linen. These underwent conservation treatment by a textile conservator
and have been digitized as well. The digitized images are available as
300ppi JPEG files.
