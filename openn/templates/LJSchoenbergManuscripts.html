### About the Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection

In 2011, University of Pennsylvania Libraries Board members Barbara
Brizdle Schoenberg and Lawrence J. Schoenberg donated their manuscript
collection of nearly 300 manuscripts and documents to the Penn
Libraries, half of which are from medieval and Renaissance
Europe. With its emphasis on the history of science and the
transmission of knowledge across time and geography, the Schoenberg
Collection brings together many of the great scientific and
philosophical traditions of the ancient and medieval worlds.
Documenting the extraordinary achievements of scholars, philosophers,
and scientists active in pre-modern Europe, Africa, and Asia, the
collection illuminates the foundations of our shared intellectual
heritage.

### Image standards and specifications

In general, The Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image follows
the NISO standards as articulated in *A Framework for Building Good
Digital Collections*, 3rd Edition:

- <http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/framework3.pdf>

The following represents specific standards adopted by SCETI in their
capture of digital images.

#### Image specifications

- Archival Masters: 600 ppi 24-bit raw TIFF color image
- "Golden Thread" color target is used for every exposure. Target also
  includes interference pattern and inch/centimeter markings. Target
  is also used to check focus.

#### Imaging and processing equipment

- Cameras: IQ280 80 megapixel Phase One digital camera
- Lenses: Schneider Kreuznach lenses
- Software: Phase One Capture One Pro; Photoshop CS3

Master images are captured at a resolution of at least 600 pixels per
inch of the image subject. Once all of the images for a manuscript have
been captured they are color-corrected, deskewed, and cropped.  

In 2015, SCETI began using IQ280 Phase One digital cameras; however,
OPenn contains images that were captured using different equipment
before this time. If you have questions about a specific manuscript or
image, please refer to the header of the Master image or images in
question or the accompanying XMP files.  You can see this, for example,
in the Master images for Penn Manuscript Ms. Codex 1096  at
<http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0002/mscodex1096/data/master/>.
Note the metadata in the image header of `0396_0000.tif` or in its
sidecar XMP file `0396_0000.tif.xmp` as seen below.

### Sponsorship

Images of manuscripts from the Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection were
digitized through grants from the National Endowment for the
Humanities. In 2009 and 2011, the Division of Preservation and Access
of the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the Penn
Libraries two grants to prepare digital facsimiles of approximately
2,200 European and American manuscripts from the eleventh through the
eighteenth centuries. Imaging was undertaken by the staff of the
Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image with coordination from
manuscripts staff in the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare
Books and Manuscripts.

Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this
website do not necessarily reflect those of the National Endowment for
the Humanities.
