### Sponsorship

Images of manuscripts from the Penn Collections were digitized through
grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The Division of
Preservation and Access of the National Endowment for the Humanities
awarded the Penn Libraries two grants (in 2009 and 2011) to prepare
digital facsimiles of approximately 2,200 European and American
manuscripts from the eleventh through the eighteenth
centuries. Imaging has been undertaken by the staff of the Schoenberg
Center for Electronic Text & Image with coordination from manuscripts
staff in the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and
Manuscripts.

Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this
website do not necessarily reflect those of the National Endowment for
the Humanities.

### On-line facsimiles

The data presented here are intended for aggregators, digital
humanists, and scholars who have been directed here to procure
high-resolution images of manuscript pages.  It is presented in a
manner most likely to ensure its long-term digital preservation.  For
those who would prefer to experience the data in a more user-friendly
way, we suggest:

### Manuscripts

Penn holds over 2,000 Western manuscripts produced before the
nineteenth century.  Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts comprise
approximately 900 items.  Holdings represented here are from Penn's
Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts.
The images of these manuscripts are accompanied by detailed manuscript
descriptions in machine-readable TEI format.  Images and TEI
manuscript descriptions are added frequently, so check often to see
new additions.
