### About Gloria Dei Church

In the 17th century Swedish settlers landed on the banks of the Delaware
River establishing churches in Wilmington, Tinicum and by the mid-17th
century in Wicaco outside of what would become Philadelphia. That latter
church, Gloria Dei, is Pennsylvania's oldest congregation. The existing
church was built between 1698 and 1700 and originally served a Swedish
Lutheran congregation. The church today is part of the Episcopal Diocese
and a national historic site. Archival records scanned as part of this
project include vestry minutes, registers, financial correspondence
between the original Swedish parishes and the churches in Philadelphia,
Delaware and New Jersey as well as their "miscellaneous records."

### Image standards and specifications

The materials from Gloria Dei Church on OPenn were scanned as part of a
CLIR-funded project to digitize the early records of Philadelphiaâ€™s
oldest congregations. Materials were digitized at the Regional Digital
Imaging Center of the Athenaeum of Philadelphia.
