The churches and synagogues of Philadelphia were gathering places in the
18th and 19th centuries and their records reflect the changing
political, social and cultural mores. More than 40,000 scanned images
from vestry and trustee minutes, baptismal, birth, marriage and death
records, pew rents, accounting records, sermons and correspondence will
give researchers opportunities to explore these connections.
Collaborating institutions include:

- Christ Church Philadelphia
- St. George's Methodist Church 
- Gloria Dei Church
- Mikveh Israel 
- African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas 
- Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania Archives 
- Presbyterian Historical Society 
- St. Peter's Episcopal Church 
- American Baptist Historical Society
- Athenaeum of Philadelphia
