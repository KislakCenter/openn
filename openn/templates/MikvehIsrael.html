### About Congregation Mikveh Israel

Congregation Mikveh Israel (officially Kahal Kadosh Mikveh Israel) is
also known as the "Synagogue of the American Revolution." The oldest
Congregation in Philadelphia, Mikveh Israel was informally established
by religious-minded Jews in British America during the 1740s, and has
become the second-oldest surviving Congregation in the United States. In
Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia in particular, Jews found an environment
of tolerance for their religious beliefs and traditions made possible by
William Penn's "great experiment." By 1775 a community of 300 strong
existed in a city of 35,000. Among items in the archives of Congregation
Mikveh Israel are letters written by George Washington and Abraham
Lincoln, and a public subscription list for the 1782 building signed by
Benjamin Franklin, David Rittenhouse, and other civic leaders.

OPenn includes some of the items from Congregation Mikveh Israel. For
