### About Bryn Mawr College Special Collections

The Bryn Mawr College Special Collections includes rare books,
manuscripts, the college archives, works of art on paper, and
ethnographic and archaeological objects.  The rare book collection
contains approximately 50,000 volumes, and includes extensive
collections of late medieval and early modern works, among them more
than 100 medieval manuscript volumes and more than 1,000 15th century
printed books.  In addition, there are strong collections on the
history of women, European interaction with Asia, Africa and the
Americas, and British and American literature.

The manuscript collections are particularly strong in women's history,
including the papers of Bryn Mawr president and early women's rights
activist M. Carey Thomas; papers of many prominent women associated
with Bryn Mawr, including poet Marianne Moore, New Yorker editor
Katharine Sergeant White, artist Anne Truitt, and archaeologists Lucy
Shoe Meritt and Dorothy Burr Thompson; and extensive collections of
letters and diaries written by Bryn Mawr students from the time of its
founding in the 1880s.  These collections are supported by a graphics
collection ranging from the 15th century to the present, including
7,300 prints, 3,500 drawings, and 13,000 vintage photographs.
