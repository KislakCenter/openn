## Accessing the data

Data on this site can be accessed in a number of ways, via the HTTP
web site, anonymous FTP, and the RSYNC remote synchronization
utility. Each of these is discussed below.

Users who want to do more than casual browsing using the siteâ€™s HTML
pages should understand its directory structure.  The site's
organization is:

```
    0_IntroductionReadMe.html                # general site information
    1_TechnicalHelpReadMe.html               # this file
    2_OPennCollection.html                   # list of collections on OPenn
    TablesOfContents/                        # individual collection listings
      |---- TOC_LJSchoenbergManuscripts.html # list of L. J. Schoenberg manuscripts
      |---- TOC_PennManuscripts.html         # list of Penn manuscripts

      |      |      |--- ...
      |      |--- ...
      |--- ...
```

Within each manuscript directory, manuscript images and metadata are
presented in a structured package, which is described below.

### HTTP Access

Individual manuscript images can be viewed and downloaded from this
site using a Web browser. Site navigation guides are in the How to use
this data set section of the ReadMe file.

There are useful tools that will allow you to perform bulk downloads
of whole documents, select document images, and entire sections from
OPenn over HTTP.  One of these is wget, which can be run on Mac OS,
Windows, and Linux computers.  Instructions for installing and using
wget are provided below in the section "Appendix: Downloading files
with wget".

### Anonymous FTP

FTP is a convenient method for doing bulk download of files and whole
directories of files.  OPenn is accessible via anonymous FTP at
`openn.library.upenn.edu`:


```
$ ftp openn.library.upenn.edu
Connected to libwsprl01.isc-seo.upenn.edu.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.2)
Name (openn.library.upenn.edu:myuser): anonymous # <== enter anonymous
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp>
```

Note that no password is needed.

Free graphical FTP clients are available for all major commercial and
free operating systems.  For configuration of FTP client software, use
the standard FTP network port, 21.

### Anonymous RSYNC

RSYNC is an application for synchronizing files between computer
systems and is probably the best tool to use for bulk retrieval of
data from OPenn.

All data on OPenn is accessible via anonymous rsync. From the command
line on Unix systems the following command can be used to list OPenn
files.

```bash
    $ rsync rsync://openn.library.upenn.edu/OPenn

    drwxrwxr-x         120 2015/04/29 14:52:07 .
    -rw-rw-r--        1857 2015/04/29 14:53:19 Collections.html
    -rw-rw-r--       10526 2015/04/29 14:53:19 ReadMe.html
    -rw-rw-r--       52220 2015/04/29 10:37:08 TechnicalReadMe.html
    drwxrwxr-x          70 2015/04/29 10:36:59 Data
    drwxrwxr-x        4096 2015/04/29 15:13:13 html
```

See the section "Appendix: Downloading files with rsync" below for
more information on using rsync.

### File naming conventions

Image files have names like:


```
    0284_0000.tif
    0284_0000_thumb.tif
    0284_0000_web.tif

    0284_0001.tif
    0284_0001_thumb.tif
    0284_0001_web.tif

    0284_0002.tif
    0284_0002_thumb.tif
    0284_0002_web.tif

    0284_0003.tif
    0284_0003_thumb.tif
    0284_0003_web.tif
```

Each image has a base name consisting of document identifier (e.g.,
`0284`), underscore, and a serial number (e.g., `0003`). Each of the
files that share a base name is a different version of the same
image. Serial numbers are in a natural order, such as book page
order. For example, if an entire book has been imaged including cover,
then the first serial number (`0000`) would be assigned to the outside
front cover, the second serial number to the inside front cover, and
so on.

```
    0284_0000
    0284_0001
    0284_0002
    0284_0003
```

Note that the parts of a document that are imaged and their order will
depend on the providing institution's practice and policies.  The
order and description of each image will be given in each document's
TEI description's `<facsimile>`.  See below for more information on
document descriptions.

The rest of the file name indicates the derivative and file type of
the image. Images are either TIFF `.tif` or JPEG `.jpg`. There are
three derivative types. They are:


- a full-sized master image, typically a TIFF;
- a web JPEG image that is 1800 pixels on its longest side; and
- a thumbnail JPEG that is 190 pixels on its longest side.

The file names indicate the derivative type through a tag, which is
the last segment of the file name before the extension .tif or
.jpg. The tag is `web` for the WEB JPEG, and `thumb` for the thumbnail
JPEG. The master image has no tag.

The following file names are for the master, web and thumbnail images
for LJS 16, image serial number `0284`:

```
    0284_0000.tif
    0284_0000_thumb.tif
    0284_0000_web.tif
```

#### XMP sidecar files

Each image is accompanied by an XMP "sidecar" file that contains the
image's metadata. Each sidecar file has the name of the image with an
additional `.xmp` extension:

```
    0284_0000.tif
    0284_0000.tif.xmp
    0284_0000_thumb.tif
    0284_0000_thumb.tif.xmp
    0284_0000_web.tif
    0284_0000_web.tif.xmp
```

See below for more information on the XMP metadata.

### Finding the file you want

Image subject names are made available in two ways: through a
human-readable browse page and through a TEI manuscript description.

Each document's browse page lists the images in order with content
names ("folio 1a", "front flyleaf 1a", etc.) and associated file
names, as can be seen here:


- <http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/html/ljs168.html>


Second, each TEI manuscript description lists all images in order in
the TEI file's `<facsimile>` section.  Note this fragment from
[ljs168_TEI.xml][ljs168_TEI]:

[ljs168_TEI]: http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs168/data/ljs168_TEI.xml "LJS 268 TEI file"

        <graphic height="1800px" url="web/0103_0004_web.jpg" width="1701px"/>
      </surface>
```

TEI manuscript description is described in greater detail below.

#### Manuscript packaging & preservation metadata

Each object's images and metadata are present in a regular package
structure that allows for automated navigation of the package and its
contents.

The directories have this structure:

```
    ljs319
    `-- data
        |-- extra
        |   |-- master
        |   |-- thumb
        |   `-- web
        |-- master
        |-- thumb
        `-- web
```

This diagram shows part of a typical package with files:

```
    ljs319
    |-- data
    |   |-- extra
    |   |   |-- master
    |   |   |   |-- ljs319_wk1_body0009a.tif
    |   |   |   |-- ljs319_wk1_body0009a.tif.xmp
    |   |   |   |-- ...
    |   |   |
    |   |   |-- thumb
    |   |   |   |-- ...
    |   |   |
    |   |   `-- web
    |   |       |-- ...
    |   |
    |   |-- ljs319_TEI.xml
    |   |-- master
    |   |   |-- 0311_0000.tif
    |   |   |-- 0311_0000.tif.xmp
    |   |   |-- 0311_0001.tif
    |   |   |-- 0311_0001.tif.xmp
    |   |   |-- 0311_0002.tif
    |   |   |-- ...
    |   |
    |   |-- thumb
    |   |   |-- 0311_0000_thumb.jpg
    |   |   |-- 0311_0000_thumb.jpg.xmp
    |   |   |-- ...
    |   |
    |   `-- web
    |       |-- 0311_0000_web.jpg
    |       |-- 0311_0000_web.jpg.xmp
    |       |-- ...
    |
    |-- manifest-sha1.txt
    `-- version.txt
```

The package is divided into the top-level directory (in this case
`ljs319`), which contains package metadata, and the data itself, found
here in the directory `ljs319/data`.  The `data` directory contains
the manuscript description and the image files and their
metadata. Each of these is described below.

#### Core and "extra" images

Core document images are in the package's `data/master`, `data/thumb`,
and `data/web` directories.  All of these images are listed in the
`<facsimile>` section of the TEI manuscript description.  Any other
files provided with the document, like color and ruler reference
shots, are included in the `data/extra` directory in `master`,
`thumb`, and `web` sub-directories.

#### Package metadata

The top-level directory contains the `data` directory and the package
metadata.

```
    ljs319
    |-- data
    |-- manifest-sha1.txt
    `-- version.txt
```

There are two package metadata files: `manifest-sha1.txt` and
`version.txt`.  The first lists each file in the data directory with
its SHA-1 checksum.  The second provides information for the *package*
version.

See below under "Preservation and technical metadata" for more on
the manifest and version files.


## Preservation and technical metadata


### Package contents and integrity

The top-level directory of each package contains a `manifest-sha1.txt`
file that lists each file in the package's data directory with its
SHA-1 checksum.

```
    ljs319
    |-- data
    |-- manifest-sha1.txt  # <= package contents and integrity file
    `-- version.txt
```

The format of the `manifest-sha1.txt` follows the format of the output
of the GNU `sha1sum` program:

```
    0d0886412592226f8a0044e7a1b0d50088830f04  data/ljs319_TEI.xml
    1f097bb51003f966e8cc709f19555581ed22ac1a  data/master/0311_0005.tif
    c9d46c1235d41074ea4e3b6e29b0e89e95d2c7c7  data/master/0311_0002.tif
    7fa693138d586ac93e229b566ac56c4d3edddf9a  data/master/0311_0003.tif.xmp
    a9c40cede3a0c5cab9214e05b4b574404c357959  data/master/0311_0007.tif.xmp
    2c239526effe30e8900410cb5c9111d279e5b447  data/master/0311_0003.tif
    ...
```

Checksums can be used to confirm a file's integrity; that is, that it
has not changed since it was last modified.

On Mac OS, Linux, and other Unix-like operating systems verification
can be done using `sha1sum` or a similar command-line utility.

Running `sha1sum` on a file will print its checksum and name:

```bash
    $ sha1sum data/ljs319_TEI.xml
    0d0886412592226f8a0044e7a1b0d50088830f04  data/ljs319_TEI.xml
```

This checksum value can be used to confirm the file has remained
unchanged.  Note that the checksum printed for `data/ljs319_TEI.xml`
by `sha1sum` is identical to the one listed in the above excerpt from
the `manifest-sha1.txt` file.

`Sha1sum` can also be used with the `-c` flag to check an entire
manifest:

```bash
    $ sha1sum -c manifest-sha1.txt
    data/ljs319_TEI.xml: OK
    data/master/0311_0005.tif: OK
    data/master/0311_0002.tif: OK
    data/master/0311_0003.tif.xmp: OK
    ...
```

There are checksum verification programs for all modern operating
systems.  Each behaves differently.  Familiarize yourself with the one
you choose.  Here are some examples:

- [Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier][miv] (Windows)
- [Mac OS X: How to verify a SHA-1 digest][macsha1] (Mac)
- [sha1sum(1) - Linux man page][sha1sum] (Linux)

### Package version

It should be a rare occurrence, but from time-to-time packages will
need to be updated.  OPenn does not yet have a full system for
managing package versions; however, in anticipation of that system
each package is provided with a `version.txt` file in its top-level
directory:

```bash
    ljs319
    |-- data
    |-- manifest-sha1.txt
    `-- version.txt        # <= package version history
```

The following is the `version.txt` file for LJS 319.

```
version: 1.0.0
date: 2015-03-24T09:55:23
id: 311
document: 311
Initial version
---
```

The file contains one or more dash-separated stanzas for each version
of a package.  The top stanza describes the most recent version of the
package.  The structure of each stanza is:

```
    version: <SEMANTIC_VERSION_OF_PACKAGE>
    date: <TIMESTAMP_OF_VERSION_RECORD>
    id: <DATABASE_ID_OF_VERSION_RECORD>
    document: <DATABASE_ID_OF_DOCUMENT>

    <DESCRIPTION/REASON>
    ---
```

- `version`: three-part semantic version number; e.g., `1.0.0`,
  `1.0.1`, or `1.1.0`.
- `date`: timestamp of this version's creation
- `id`: database identifier of this version
- `document`: database identifier of the package document
- `description`: the reason for this version

**Semantic versioning**

OPenn uses semantic versions with a three-component version number:

```
    <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>
```

Example:

```
    1.0.0
```

New versions of a package contain alterations of data and metadata
content.  Version number changes indicate the type of change and
whether a new version will likely be compatible with applications
built on previous versions of the package.

All OPenn packages are machine readable and follow a regular pattern.
Any application that loads OPenn data dynamically should have no
problem with changing package contents; however, applications that
cache part of the data may fail to work with a new version of a
package that, for example, has fewer images or removed metadata.

A change to the last digit (e.g., `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`) indicates a
*patch* or correction that does not add or remove data or metadata.
The package remains compatible with applications built on the previous
version of the package.  An example of a patch change would be a
spelling correction in metadata.

A *minor version* change (e.g., `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`), indicates the
addition of new data or metadata.  The package will be work with
applications built on the previous version.  An example of a minor
change would be the addition of new metadata to the document's
manuscript description or the addition of new images to the data
set. While the new version will work as before, it may be desirable to
update software to take advantage of new data.

A *major version* change (e.g., `1.1.0` to `2.0.0`) indicates the
removal of data or metadata or other substantive change that will
likely cause this version to not work with software built on a
previous version of the package.

### Descriptive and structural metadata

A TEI file like `ljs319_TEI.xml` provides descriptive and structural
metadata for each document.  The file is stored and named as follows:

```
     <PACKAGEDIR>/data/<PACKAGEDIR>_TEI.xml
```

Example:

```
     ljs319/data/ljs319_TEI.xml
```

The TEI file name always contains the name of the top-level package
directory.

See the section TEI manuscript description below for a detailed
description of file.

### XMP

Each image file has key metadata stored in its header.  This
information is also included in a `.xmp` sidecar file for each image:

```
    0311_0000.tif
    0311_0000.tif.xmp
    0311_0000_thumb.jpg
    0311_0000_thumb.jpg.xmp
    0311_0000_web.jpg
    0311_0000_web.jpg.xmp
```

The XMP file includes Dublin Core and technical metadata and rights
information.  What follows is the content of a sample XMP file.

```xml

        </respStmt>
    </msItem>
```

### Subdivision content information

TEI `msItem` elements *after* the first `msItem` contain section and
chapter titles.  These elements can be distinguished from the general
document-level `msItem` by the presence of the `@n` attribute and
child `locus` element.

Elements:

```
    /TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/sourceDesc/msDesc/msContents/msItem
    /TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/sourceDesc/msDesc/msContents/msItem/title
    /TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/sourceDesc/msDesc/msContents/msItem/locus
```

Example:

```xml
    <msItem n="1r">
        <locus>1r</locus>
        <title>Sefer ha-K?anon, f. 1r</title>
    </msItem>
    <msItem n="118r">
        <locus>118r</locus>
        <title>Ma?amar ha-nikhbad, f. 118r</title>
    </msItem>
```

The `msItem/@n` attribute corresponds to the `facsimile/surface`
element with the same `@n` attribute.

            narrower columns for rhumbs and distance measurements; ruled
            faintly in lead.
        </layout>
    </layoutDesc>
```

## Standards

OPenn data and metadata adhere to international standards. The
following is a list of the most important of those.

- Dublin Core: each image includes descriptive Dublin Core metadata
  based on the Dublin Core Metadata Elements (DCME);
  for more information on DCME, see the [Dublin Core site][DCME]

- TEI P5: manuscript description information is encoded according to
  [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) P5 guidelines][teip5]

- TIFF: when available TIFF images are used for master images; the
  [TIFF specification][TIFF] is available as PDF from the Adobe
  website

- Unicode: text information in XML files and other text documents is
  in Unicode, typically with UTF-8 encoding; visit
  [Unicode.org][Unicode] for information on the Unicode standard

- XMP: [Extensible Metadata Platform][XMP]; all images have
  XMP-encoded metadata in their headers and are accompanied by XMP
  sidecar files

[DCME]: http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ "Dublin Core Metadata Elements"
[TIFF]: https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFF6.pdf "TIFF Revision 6.0"

## Appendix: Downloading files with wget

This section provides instructions for using wget to download files
from OPenn. Wget is a command-line utility available for Linux, Mac
OS, and Windows.


### Installing wget

First, youâ€™ll need to install wget on your computer.

#### Mac OS

On a Mac you can install wget directly --
[Install and configure wget on OS X][icwosx] -- or if you already have
[the Homebrew package installer][homebrew] you can use it.

[icwosx]: http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/install-and-configure-wget-on-os-x/ "Coolest Guides on the Planet: Install wget on OS X Yosemite"
[homebrew]: http://brew.sh "Homebrew home page"

#### Windows

Download the appropriate setup*.exe file from
<http://cygwin.com/install.html>. Double-click `setup*.exe` and choose
"Install from Internet".  Follow the prompts until you are asked to
choose a download site for cygwin. Choose any site and continue.
Follow the prompts again, until you get to the "Select Packages" page.
Click the **+** next to Web (you may need to scroll down), then click
directly on "Skip" and select the first box next to "wget: Utility to
retrieve files from the WWW via HTTP and FTP".  Click next, accept any
dependencies. Download and installation may take a few minutes.

#### Navigating the command line

Cygwin will install its own folders. Wget will download files into
these folders, and you can move the files later.

On a Mac, open your Terminal program. It will probably open in your
Documents directory. On Windows, open the Cygwin terminal.

Your command prompt will look something like this, ending with a `$`:

```
    abc123:Documents user$
```

To move into a different directory, use the cd command:

```
    $ cd openn
```

Your command prompt will reflect your new location:

```
    abc123:openn user$
```

To see all the files and folders available to you, use the ls command:

```
    $ ls
```

To create a new folder, use the mkdir command:

```
    $ mkdir LJSManuscripts
```

More information about these commands and others can be found on this
[OS X command line cheat sheet][cheat].

[cheat]: https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet/wiki/Terminal-Cheatsheet-for-Mac-%28-basics-%29 "Mac OS Terminal cheat sheet"

Now on to wget.

#### Using wget

The basic `wget` command will download a single file into the directory
you are in. So

```
    $ wget http://openn.library.upenn.edu/
```

will download the index.html page at that address. However, this is
probably not what you want. You want to download image and metadata
files, either for the complete collection or for specific
manuscripts. There are a number of different commands that will allow
you to control what exactly gets downloaded, and where those files are
placed on your computer.

#### wget Recipes

##### Download a single file

I want to download a single image for a specific manuscript:

```
    $ wget http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs16/data/web/0284_0000_web.jpg
```

This will bring down only that image that you specify. You can use the
same command to download the XML manuscript description:

```
    $ wget http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs16/data/ljs16_TEI.xml
```

##### Download multiple files

You can also use wget to bulk-download files.

I want to download all of the LJS Manuscript data, including master,
thumbnail, and web images, and XML manuscript descriptions, in the
directory structure used on the OPenn site:

```
    $ wget -np -r http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/
```

- `wget` = use the wget program
- `-np` = "no parent", this means do not download any files that are
  in the folders containing the LJSchoenbergManuscripts folder
- `-r` = "recursive", this means download files directly in the
  LJSchoenbergManuscripts folder, and also download any files that are
  in folders inside that folder (without this command, you would only
  get those files directly inside the LJSchoenbergManuscripts folder)
- `http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/` =
  start download from this location

I want to download only the XML manuscript descriptions and jpeg files
(thumbnails and web images) for a single manuscript. All files are
saved in a folder named ljs225

```
    $ wget -nd -np -r -A.jpg -A.xml -P openn/ljs225 \
        http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs225/
```

- `wget` = use the wget program
- `-nd` = "no directory", this means do not use the directory
  structure from OPenn, put all the files into a folder specified by
  me
- `-np` = "no parent", see above
- `-r` = "recursive", see above
- `-A.jpg` = "accept list", accept only .jpg files
- `-A.xml` = "accept list", accept only .xml files
- `-P openn/ljs225` = "directory prefix", the folder to which all the files will be downloaded
- `http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs225/` = start download from this location

I want to download all the web JPEGs for *all* the manuscripts in
OPenn to a folder called `data/web`.

```
    $ wget -nd -np -r -A _web.jpg -P data/web http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data
```

- `wget` = use the wget program
- `-nd` = "no directory", see above
- `-np` = "no parent", see above
- `-r` = "recursive", see above
- `-A.xml` = "accept list", accept only .xml files
- `-P openn/msDesc` = "directory prefix", see above
- `http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/` = start download from this
  location

You can combine the different commands to specify exactly what you
want to download.

## Appendix: Downloading files with rsync

Rsync is a command-line Remote SYNChronization designed to maintain
duplicate copies of data on remote machines.  It is also a very
powerful tool for the bulk downloading of files.  The instructions
below show how to install rsync and use it to download files from
OPenn.

One advantage rsync has over other tools is that it does, by default,
synchronize two directories, usually one a remote server and one on a
local computer.  This means that rsync can be run multiple times on
the same two directories and it will only copy new and changed files
from the source to the destination.  It can also be set up not just to
copy new and changed files, but also to remove files from the
destination that are no longer on the target, and thus keep two file
systems truly synchronized.

The Linux manual page for rsync is here:
<http://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync>.  Note that rsync is different for
each operating sytem.  For complete rsync documentation for your
system view the rsync man page (`man rsync`).

Rsync commands can be quite complex and tricky to get working just
right.  There are ample resources on the web for answering particular
rsync questions.  The samples below show basic usage of rsync for
copying data.

### Installing rsync

First, youâ€™ll need to install wget on your computer.

#### Mac OS & Linux

Mac OS ships with rsync installed.

If your Linux system does not have rsync installed, you can install
with your package management software.

#### Windows

Download the appropriate setup*.exe file from
<http://cygwin.com/install.html>. Double-click `setup*.exe` and choose
"Install from Internet".  Follow the prompts until you are asked to
choose a download site for cygwin. Choose any site and continue.
Follow the prompts again, until you get to the "Select Packages" page.
Click the **+** next to Net (you may need to scroll down), then click
directly on "Skip" and select the first box next to "rysnc".  Click
next, accept any dependencies.  Download and installation may take a
few minutes.

#### Navigating the command line

Cygwin will install its own folders. Wget will download files into
these folders, and you can move the files later.

On a Mac, open your Terminal program. It will probably open in your
Documents directory. On Windows, open the Cygwin terminal.

Your command prompt will look something like this, ending with a `$`:

```
    abc123:Documents user$
```

To move into a different directory, use the cd command:

```
    $ cd openn
```

Your command prompt will reflect your new location:

```
    abc123:openn user$
```

To see all the files and folders available to you, use the ls command:

```
    $ ls
```

To create a new folder, use the mkdir command:

```
    $ mkdir LJSManuscripts
```

More information about these commands and others can be found on this
[OS X command line cheat sheet][cheat].

[cheat]: https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet/wiki/Terminal-Cheatsheet-for-Mac-%28-basics-%29 "Mac OS Terminal cheat sheet"

Now on to rsync.

#### Using rsync

The basic rsync command, when issued on a site providing anonymous
rsync like OPenn will list a directory's contents:

```
    $ rsync rsync://openn.library.upenn.edu/OPenn

    drwxrwxr-x         120 2015/04/29 14:52:07 .
    -rw-rw-r--        1857 2015/04/29 14:53:19 Collections.html
    -rw-rw-r--       10526 2015/04/29 14:53:19 ReadMe.html
    -rw-rw-r--       52220 2015/04/29 10:37:08 TechnicalReadMe.html
    drwxrwxr-x          70 2015/04/29 10:36:59 Data
    drwxrwxr-x        4096 2015/04/29 15:13:13 html
```

Adding a subfolder to the above command will give a list of items in
that folder:

```
    $ rsync rsync://openn.library.upenn.edu/OPenn/Data/

    drwxrwxr-x          70 2015/04/29 10:36:59 .
    drwxrwxr-x        8192 2015/04/29 10:26:53 LJSchoenbergManuscripts
    drwxrwxr-x        4096 2015/04/29 10:36:59 PennManuscripts

    $ rsync rsync://openn.library.upenn.edu/OPenn/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/

    drwxrwxr-x        8192 2015/04/29 10:26:53 .
    drwxrwxr-x        8192 2015/04/29 10:49:39 html
    drwxrwxr-x          75 2015/02/13 11:26:05 ljs101
    drwxrwxr-x          75 2015/01/28 18:40:19 ljs102
    drwxrwxr-x          75 2015/01/28 18:40:18 ljs103
```


Note the trailing `/` character after `Data` and
`LJSchoenbergManuscripts`.


#### Downloading an entire document

You can pull down an entire document from OPenn by entering the path
to its directory. This command will download all of LJS 49 to the user
tom's Manuscripts directory:

```
    $ rsync -a \
        rsync://openn.library.upenn.edu/OPenn/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs49/ \
        /Users/tom/Manuscripts/
```

> Note that the final `\` character on the first and second lines is
> used to break up the long line.  If entered on the command line the
> `\` must be the last character on the line and cannot be followed by
> spaces.

That command will silently retrieve all of LJS 49. To get more detailed
information about what is happening, you could use a command like the
following:

```
    $ rsync -av --progress \
        rsync://openn.library.upenn.edu/OPenn/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs49/ \
        /Users/tom/Manuscripts/
```

Be aware that the data set is quite large, and the images for a single
manuscripts can be over 100 GB.

#### Download select document images

You can pull down a specific set of images for a document (master
TIFFs, or web or thumbnail JPEGs) by specifying the image folder. This
command will retrieve all web JPEGs for manuscript LJS 49:

```
    $ rsync -av \
        rsync://openn.library.upenn.edu/OPenn/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs49/data/web/ \
        /Users/tom/Manuscripts/
```

Rsync also offers the ability to select source files by regular
expression, so that very precise selection files for download can be
made based on patterns of filenames.

#### Mirroring all of OPenn

You can use rsync to mirror OPenn. Here is a command that will do a
simple copy of all of OPenn to another file system:

```
    $ rsync -av --delete rsync://openn.library.upenn.edu/OPenn /var/www/html
```

Here the `--delete` option will delete any files `/var/www/html` not
found on OPenn.  This command can be run regularly to keep an
up-to-date local copy of OPenn on your system.  In production, you
would want to fine tune this command to your situation.

As noted above, rsync is extremely powerful and flexible.  Experiment
with rsync and look among the many resources on rsync on the Web to
learn more about rsync and using it for your needs.
