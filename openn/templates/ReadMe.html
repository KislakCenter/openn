## Sponsorship

Many of the manuscripts on OPenn were digitized through grants and
awards from public and private donors.  See each collection's page for
information about the sponsorship and support that made possible the
wealth of materials available through OPenn.

## Intended audiences

The data on OPenn is intended for aggregators, digital humanists, and
scholars who have been directed here to procure high-resolution images
of manuscript pages. It is presented in a manner most likely to ensure
its long-term digital preservation. Many of the images here are
available via more user-friendly page-turning applications on
institutional websites.  See individual collection pages for details.

## Let us know how we're doing

We are most grateful for your feedback. If you find any errors, have
suggestions or comments about what we've done well or need to do
better, or if you need help using OPenn, please let us know at

## Contents

### Documents

The documents represented on this site represent the richness and
breadth of their holding collections.  See each collection's page for
more information on respective holdings.  The images of these
documents are accompanied by detailed manuscript descriptions in
machine-readable TEI format. Images and TEI manuscript descriptions
are added frequently, so check often to see new additions.

We will regularly be adding new collections in order to bring more
OPenn data to the public.  Check back often to see what's new.

### Manuscript images

We present the highest quality images available.  As a general rule
these will include a 24-bit archival TIFF image of at least 400 ppi.

#### Images

Three types of images are delivered for each manuscript element:

1. a full-sized, archival image, typically a TIFF image, 400 ppi or
   better
2. a standard all-purpose JPEG intended for web use, that is 1800
   pixels on its longest side; and
3. a thumbnail JPEG that is 190 pixels on its longest side.

All TIFF images are master files. JPEG derivative image types are
indicated by a "tag." For example,

- `0023_0012.tif`
- `0023_0012_web.jpg`
- `0023_0012_thumb.jpg`

The file name base (e.g., `0023_0012`) has two parts: a four-digit
prefix, representing an arbitrarily assigned identifier, like `0023`,
and a four-digit serial number indicating the document order of each
image relative to the others in the set.  For example, notice these
master image names:

- `0023_0001.tif` - outside front cover of book
- `0023_0002.tif` - inside front cover of book
- `0023_0003.tif` - front flyleaf i recto
- `0023_0004.tif` - front flyleaf i verso
- `0023_0005.tif` - folio 1r
- `0023_0006.tif` - folio 1v
-   ...

Label information for images can be found on each document's browse
page and in the TEI XML manuscript description.

### Manuscript descriptions

Manuscript cataloging incorporates not only the identification of the
author, title, date of origin, and provenance, but also, detailed
descriptions intended to aid the palaeographer, codicologist, art
historian, historian, and philologist.  A description of the
manuscript cataloging, with technical and non-technical detail, is
given in the Technical ReadMe document.

## How to use this data set

This data set contains complete digital surrogates for the manuscripts
it contains. All manuscripts are provided with machine-readable TEI
manuscript descriptions. We provide HTML access to the files, which is
easier for the individual user to navigate. HTML and directory
structure access are described below.

### HTML access

To ease human navigation of the site, a series of web pages is
provided. The entry point is the [Collections.html](/Collections.html)
file, which lists all of the collections currently on the site. There
links can be found to collection-specific manuscript listings (files
like
[LJSchoenbergManuscripts.html](/html/LJSchoenbergManuscripts.html)). The
amount of detail for each manuscript varies, based on the manuscript's
catalog record.

A typical entry for a manuscript will look something like this:

{% endmarkdown %}
<ul class="ul_documents">
<li><span class="item-id">LJS 208:</span> <span class="item-name">Opusculum mathematicum</span> <span class="item-origin">(Genoa?, Italy, 1675.)</span><br/>
    <span class="page-link"><a
    href="/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/html/ljs208.html">Browse</a></span>
    | <span class="page-link"><a
    href="/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs208/data/ljs208_TEI.xml">TEI
    XML</a></span> | <span class="page-link"><a href="/Data/LJSchoenbergManuscripts/ljs208">Data</a></span></li>
</ul>

{% markdown %}

### Alternate access methods and other technical stuff

We also provide access via anonymous FTP and anonymous RSYNC.  For
information on access data from OPenn using those methods and the
command-line tool `wget`, as well as detailed information on OPenn
descriptive and structural metadata, the [technical readme
document](/TechnicalReadMe.html).
