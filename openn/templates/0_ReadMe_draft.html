# Sponsorship

Images of manuscripts from the Lawrence J. Schoenberg manuscripts and
the Penn Collections were digitized through grants from the National
Endowment for the Humanities. The Division of Preservation and Access
of the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the Penn
Libraries two grants (in 2009 and 2011) to prepare digital facsimiles
of approximately 2,200 European and American manuscripts from the
eleventh through the eighteenth centuries. Imaging has been undertaken
by the staff of the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image with
coordination from manuscripts staff in the Kislak Center for Special
Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts.

Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this
Web site do not necessarily reflect those of the National Endowment
for the Humanities.

# Intended audiences

The data on the OPenn is intended for aggregators, digital humanists,
and scholars who have been directed here to procure high-resolution
images of manuscript pages. It is presented in a manner most likely to
ensure its long-term digital preservation. For those who would prefer
to experience the data in a more user-friendly way, we suggest:

- [Penn in Hand][PennInHand], bibliographic information and digital
  facsimiles for selected collections of manuscripts
  (<http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/index.html>).

# Contents

## Manuscripts

Penn holds over 2,000 Western manuscripts produced before the 19th
century. Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts comprise approximately
900 items, the earliest dating from 1000 A.D. The Lawrence
J. Schoenberg Collection emphasizes secular topics, especially science
and mathematics, and includes tablets from the 21st to 18th centuries
B.C.  Holdings represented here are from Penn's Kislak Center for
Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, as well as from the
private collection of Lawrence J. Schoenberg (C'53, WG'56)??. The
images of these manuscripts are accompanied by detailed manuscript
description information in machine-readable TEI format.  Images and
TEI manuscript descriptions are added frequently, so check often to
see new additions.

We intend to collaborate with outside institutions in the
Philadelphia area to bring OPenn data to the public.  Check back to
see new collections from outside of Penn added in the future.


## The Manuscript images

In general, Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image follows
the NISO standards as articulated in A Framework for Building Good
Digital Collection, 3rd Edition
(<http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/frameworks3.pdf>).
The following represents specific standards adopted by SCETI in their
capture of digital images.

### Scanning specifications

- Archival Masters: 600 ppi 24-bit raw TIFF image, 600 ppi 24-bit LZW
  color image
- "Golden Thread" color target is used for every exposure.  Targe also
  includes interference pattern and inch/centimeter markings.  Target
  is also used to check focus.

### Scanning & Processing Equipment

- Cameras: Two auto-focus, 39 megapixel, Phase One P45 digital cameras.
- Lenses: Schneider-Krueznach lenses
- Software: Phase One Capture One Pro; Photoshop CS3

Master images are captured at a resolution of at least 600 pixels
per inch of the image subject. Once all of the images for a manuscript
have been captured they are color-corrected, deskewed, and
cropped.

### Images

Three types of images are delivered for each manuscript
element:

1. a full-sized, archival TIFF image, (600 PPI text folios);
2. a standard all-purpose JPEG intended for web use, that is 1800
   pixels on its longest side; and
3. a thumbnail JPEG that is 190 pixels on its longest side.

All TIFF images are master files. JPEG derivative image types are
indicated by a "tag". For example,

- `0023_0012.tif`
- `0023_0012_web.jpg`
- `0023_0012_thumb.jpg`


The file name base (e.g., `0023_0012`) has two parts: a four-digit
prefix, representing an arbitrarily assigned identifier, like `0023`,
and a four-digit serial number indicating the document order of each
image relative to the others in the set. For example, notice these
master image names:

- `0023_0001.tif` - outside front cover of book
- `0023_0002.tif` - inside front cover of book
- `0023_0003.tif` - front flyleaf i recto
- `0023_0004.tif` - front flyleaf i verso
- `0023_0005.tif` - folio 1r
- `0023_0006.tif` - folio 1v
- ...

Label information for images can be found on each document's browse
page and in the TEI XML manuscript description.

## Manuscript descriptions

Manuscript cataloging incorporates not only the identification of the
author and title of works, and the date of origin and provenance of
the manuscripts, but also detailed descriptions intended to aid the
palaeographer, codicologist, art historian, historian, and
philologist. A description of the manuscript cataloging, with
technical and non-technical detail, is given in the document
ManuscriptDescription.html (TBD).

# How to use this data set

This data set contains complete digital surrogates for the manuscripts
it contains. All manuscripts are provided with machine-readable TEI
manuscript descriptions. We provide HTML access to the files, which is
easier for the individual user to navigate. HTML and directory
structure access are described below.

## HTML access

To ease human navigation of the site, a series of web pages is
provided. The entry point is the 3_Collections.html file, which lists
all of the collections currently on the site. The amount of detail for
each manuscript varies, based on the progress of the manuscript’s
cataloging.

A typical entry for a manuscript will look something like this:

- Ms. Codex 1589: Texts for the Commemorative Office of the Virgin Mary and notated Office of the Dead (Elchingen, 1596)

# Collections on OPenn

In addition to Penn manuscripts, this data set will soon include
images from books and manuscripts from non-Penn collections. Note that
each of these items has its own licensing terms, and it is the
responsibility of each user to understand and adhere to those terms.
