### About the Presbyterian Historical Society

Organized in 1852, the Presbyterian Historical Society is the oldest
denominational archives in the United States and serves as the national
archives for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and its predecessor
denominations. PHS exists to collect, preserve, and share the story of
the American Presbyterian and Reformed experience with Presbyterians,
the scholarly community, and the general public. 

The society’s holdings include more than 250,000 titles reflecting the
history of the Presbyterian tradition in America and over 30,000 cubic
feet of official records and personal papers. These include records of
congregations, presbyteries, synods, and General Assembly agencies of
the current and some predecessor Presbyterian and Reformed denominations
in America.

These records are supplemented by the personal papers (including
correspondence, diaries, and photographs) of significant Presbyterians
and ecumenists, with a particular emphasis on mission history in this
country and abroad. The society also serves as the archives for
ecumenical organizations including the Federal and National Council of
Churches, the American Sunday School Union, and Religious News Service.

OPenn includes some of the items from the Presbyterian Historical
Society. For more information on all available collections see:
