### Image standards and specifications

Images from the Abraham Lincoln Foundation collections were shot and
processed by the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image. In
general, SCETI follows the NISO standards as articulated in *A
Framework for Building Good Digital Collections*, 3rd Edition:

- <http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/framework3.pdf>

The following represents specific standards adopted by SCETI in their
capture of digital images.

#### Image specifications

- Archival Masters: 600 ppi 24-bit raw TIFF color image
- "Golden Thread" color target is used for every exposure. Target also
  includes interference pattern and inch/centimeter markings. Target
  is also used to check focus.

#### Imaging and processing equipment

- Cameras: IQ280 80 megapixel Phase One digital camera
- Lenses: Schneider Kreuznach lenses
- Software: Phase One Capture One Pro; Photoshop CS3

Master images are captured at a resolution of at least 600 pixels per
inch of the image subject. Once all of the images for a manuscript have
been captured they are color-corrected, deskewed, and cropped.  

In 2015, SCETI began using IQ280 Phase One digital cameras; however,
OPenn contains images that were captured using different equipment
before this time. If you have questions about a specific manuscript or
image, please refer to the header of the Master image or images in
question or the accompanying XMP files.  You can see this, for example,
in the Master images for Penn Manuscript Ms. Codex 1096  at
<http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0002/mscodex1096/data/master/>.
Note the metadata in the image header of `0396_0000.tif` or in its
sidecar XMP file `0396_0000.tif.xmp` as seen below.
