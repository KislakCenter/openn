### About the Special Collections of The University of Manchester Library 

The Library’s manuscripts and archives are internationally important.
Their subject range is extraordinarily diverse and the collections span
many centuries, from the 3rd millennium BCE to the 21st century. There
is also a very wide range of formats. European manuscripts include
hundreds of medieval codices, and there are major collections of Arabic,
Persian, Turkish and Hebrew manuscripts. The Library holds the archives
of hundreds of companies, trade unions, charities, social organizations
and religious institutions, as well as individuals. Particular strengths
include Nonconformist archives, modern literary archives, archives of
The University of Manchester, and papers of individual scientists and
academics from Manchester.

The rare book collections are amongst the finest in the world. They
encompass almost all the landmarks of printing through five centuries,
including magnificent illustrated books. Examples of fine printing,
landmark works in typography, key historical texts and exquisite
bookbindings. They cover a wide range of subjects: theology and
philosophy; economic, social, political and military history; travel and
exploration; literature, drama and music; art and archaeology; science
and medicine. Highlights include: over 4,000 incunables; a remarkable
collection of 16th-century Italian books; one of the greatest
collections in the world covering the entire history of the printed
Bible; internationally important collections of French Revolutionary
material, Nonconformist literature, and scientific and medical texts.

The Library’s significant Visual Collection comprises: paintings,
drawings, photographs, sculptures, textiles, ceramics, glass, archives,
manuscripts, prints, papers, illustrated and painted books, and
associated objects. Dating from the ancient world to the present, its
representation of visual culture is excellent, of international scope,
importance and interest.

OPenn includes some of the items from the Hebrew Collections. The Hebrew
manuscripts comprise over 400 items, dating from the 14th to the 19th
centuries and ranging geographically as far afield as Morocco, Yemen and
Honan in China, as well as Europe; they include magnificent Torah
scrolls, prayer-books, apocryphal writings, commentaries, treatises,
letters, marriage contracts and piyyûtîm. For more information on all of
