### About the Rosenbach

Home to a collection of nearly 400,000 rare books, manuscripts, and ﬁne
and decorative art objects, including some of the best-known literary
and historical objects in the world, the Rosenbach serves everyone from
school children and families to scholars and casual visitors from around
the corner and around the globe.

The Rosenbach seeks to inspire curiosity, inquiry, and creativity by
engaging broad audiences in exhibitions, programs, and research based on
its remarkable and expanding collections. In December 2013, the
Rosenbach became afﬁliated with the Free Library of Philadelphia
Foundation, bringing together two of the world’s preeminent collections
of rare books, manuscripts, Americana and art. The combined holdings of
the Rosenbach and the Free Library of Philadelphia inspire unique
exhibitions and programs throughout the year.

OPenn includes some of the items from the Rosenbach. For more
